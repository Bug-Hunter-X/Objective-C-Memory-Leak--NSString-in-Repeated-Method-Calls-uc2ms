In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically regarding object ownership and the `retain`/`release` cycle (or its modern equivalent, Automatic Reference Counting â€“ ARC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

If `someMethod` is called multiple times, each call creates a new `NSString` instance.  If no explicit `release` (or equivalent ARC handling) is performed, there's a memory leak.  The `myString` property retains the string, but no mechanism releases the older string, leading to accumulating unused memory. This is easily overlooked if the program flow is not closely examined.
